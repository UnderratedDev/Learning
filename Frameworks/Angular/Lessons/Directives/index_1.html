            The ng-app directive also tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of the AngularJS application.
            The {{ firstName }} expression, in the example above, is an AngularJS data binding expression.

            Data binding in AngularJS binds AngularJS expressions with AngularJS data.

            {{ firstName }} is bound with ng-model="firstName. -->
