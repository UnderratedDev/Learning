            The ng-app directive also tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of the AngularJS application.
            The {{ firstName }} expression, in the example above, is an AngularJS data binding expression.

            Data binding in AngularJS binds AngularJS expressions with AngularJS data.

            {{ firstName }} is bound with ng-model="firstName. -->
        <div data-ng-app = "" data-ng-init = "firstName : 'Yudhvir'">
            <p>Name : <input type = "text" data-ng-model = "firstName"></p>
            <p> You wrote : {{ firstName }} </p>
