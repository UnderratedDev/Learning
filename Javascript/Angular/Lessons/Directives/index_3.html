            The ng-app directive also tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of the AngularJS application.
            The {{ firstName }} expression, in the example above, is an AngularJS data binding expression.

            Data binding in AngularJS binds AngularJS expressions with AngularJS data.

            {{ firstName }} is bound with ng-model="firstName.
            AngularJS is perfect for database CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) applications.
            Just imagine if these objects were records from a database. -->

        <!--
            The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

            The ng-model directive can also:

            Provide type validation for application data (number, email, required).
            Provide status for application data (invalid, dirty, touched, error).
            Provide CSS classes for HTML elements.
            Bind HTML elements to HTML forms -->
        <div data-ng-app = "" data-ng-init = "names = [ {name : 'Yudhvir', country : 'England'}, {name : 'Andrew', country : 'Canada'}, {name : 'Esa', country : 'Canada'} ]">
            <ul>
                <li data-ng-repeat = "x in names">
                    {{ x.name + ', ' + x.country  }}
