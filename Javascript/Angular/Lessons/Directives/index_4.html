            In addition to all the built-in AngularJS directives, you can create your own directives.

            New directives are created by using the .directive function.

            To invoke the new directive, make an HTML element with the same tag name as the new directive.

            When naming a directive, you must use a camel case name, w3TestDirective, but when invoking it,
            you must use - separated name, w3-test-directive:

            You can invoke a directive by using:

            Element name
            Attribute
            Class
            Comment
            <w3-test-directive></w3-test-directive>
            <div w3-test-directive></div>
            <div class="w3-test-directive"></div>
            commentstart directive: w3-test-directive commentend  -->
        <script>
            var app = angular.module ("myApp", []);
            app.directive ("w3TestDirective", function () {
                return {
                    template : "<h1>Made by a directive!</h1>"
                };
            });
        </script>
