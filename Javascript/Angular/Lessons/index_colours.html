            The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.

            The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.

            The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view.

            The ng-app directive tells AngularJS that the <div> element is the "owner" of an AngularJS application.

            The ng-model directive binds the value of the input field to the application variable name.

            The ng-bind directive binds the innerHTML of the <p> element to the application variable name.

            You can use data-ng-, instead of ng-, if you want to make your page HTML valid. -->
        <div data-ng-app = "" data-ng-init = "myCol = 'lightblue'">
            <input style = "background-color:{{myCol}}" ng-model = "myCol" value = "{{myCol}}" />
        <div>
